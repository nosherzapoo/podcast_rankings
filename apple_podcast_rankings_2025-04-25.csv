It is summarized by an A.I. chat bot like this: """"TCB is an improv-comedy, interview, and variety podcast hosted by longtime best friends Bryan Green and Krissy Hoadley. Often described as the ""Cheesecake Factory of comedy podcasts,"" it’s a show that proudly embraces its chaotic, unpolished charm—self-aware that it’s ""just FINE"" and not for everyone. Airing Tuesday through Friday, the duo dives into their quirky friendship, blending twisted humor with discussions on pop culture, internet oddities, relationship drama, and dark comedy. They also have celebrity guests each Tuesday, play games and offer intentionally half-baked responses to listener questions and comments, creating a vibe that feels like a casual, irreverent escape from everyday life.
The podcast features a mix of standalone episodes and a Tuesday ""TCB Infomercial"" series, where they bring in notable guests—think comedians like Ron Funches, Ari Shaffir, Hannah Berner, Steve-O, Tom Papa or Felipe Esparza—to riff on everything from personal anecdotes to absurd life experiences. Show topics can range from the mundane (spam texts, bad dating advice) to the bizarre (Mountain Monsters, Naked Attraction reactions), often veering into unexpected tangents that highlight their offbeat chemistry. It’s less about structure and more about the raw, relatable banter between two people who’ve known each other for decades, making listeners feel like they’re eavesdropping on a hilarious, unfiltered conversation.""""

So, if you’ve been running yourself ragged trying to be everything for everyone and still wondering why you feel like crap, buckle up. It’s time to step into the role of the main character in your own life.

Hilary’s the straight-talking, script-flipping, former psychotherapist you didn’t know you needed—part brain science, part universal laws, and 100% no b******t. She’s your bestie with receipts, here to help you stop waiting for permission, start trusting yourself, and finally build a life that feels as good as it looks.

Every week, Hilary dives into the real stuff—confidence, boundaries, aging, relationships, success—all the things that actually matter, without the fluff (or the toxic positivity). Just real talk, hard truths, and tools that work, served up with little spoonfuls of sweetness to help the medicine go down.

New episodes drop every Friday on all podcast platforms and YouTube.

Her posts about witchcraft and ""alien baths"" draw in over a million followers, all chasing the dream of a lifestyle like hers. But as she gathers more followers around her, the secrets beneath her fame grow darker and more dangerous.
One woman sets out to bring back her best friend who has fallen under the spell of this modern-day guru. And what begins as a search for a missing friend soon puts her on a collision course with Kat.
Based on the hit Brazilian podcast, journalist Chico Felitti uncovers a gripping story of influence, control, and those who dare to fight back.

When we face challenges in life, we seek answers from people we believe can help us. When tragedy strikes an exclusive retreat with a self-help superstar, many people are left to wonder: how far is too far? James Arthur Ray was an Oprah-endorsed self-help teacher who achieved fame, fortune, and influence. But friends and family members of his followers questioned his unorthodox methods, and tried to stop him. From Wondery, the makers of ""Dirty John,"" ""Dr. Death,"" and ""The Shrink Next Door,"" comes a story about the dark side of enlightenment. Hosted by journalist Matt Stroud.

Start Living.
Most of us have been conditioned to believe a lie.

We’re told that our worth is something to be earned, that we need to achieve more, hustle harder, and prove ourselves before we can finally feel like we matter.

But no matter how much we accomplish, something still feels missing.

Why? Because mattering isn’t something you prove—it’s something you create.

And everything changes when you stop proving your worth—and start embodying it.

Why Passion Struck is Different
Most personal growth podcasts focus on hacks and habits—but they miss the deeper question:

👉 Why do we feel unfulfilled, even when we’re doing everything “right”?

Passion Struck is different because it’s built on a deeper truth.

✅ You don’t find meaning—you create it.
✅ Fulfillment isn’t external—it’s built from within.
✅ The life you want isn’t ahead of you—it’s in the choices you make today.

What You’ll Learn
Hosted by John R. Miles, a former Fortune 50 executive and expert on intentional living, Passion Struck brings together top scientists, psychologists, health experts, and thought leaders to explore:

🧠 The Science of Purpose—How your brain is wired for meaning.
💡 The Psychology of Transformation—Why lasting change is hard—and how to make it stick.
⚡ The Mind-Body Connection—How holistic health fuels passion, energy, and performance.
🚀 The New Rules of Success—How to lead, thrive, and matter in a fast-changing world.

This Isn’t Just a Podcast—It’s a Wake-Up Call.
A challenge to stop waiting.
To stop proving.
To start creating a life that truly matters.
